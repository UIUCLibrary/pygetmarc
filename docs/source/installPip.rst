Installation with PIP
---------------------

If you have access to the `University of Illinois Python package repository <https://devpi.library.illinois.edu/>`_, and
there is an `existing package <https://devpi.library.illinois.edu/production/release/uiucprescon-getmarc>`_, this is
going to be the easiest option to install.



1) Open a command prompt/terminal.
2) Activate your Python 3 environment.
3) Type the following command::

    python -m pip install uiucprescon-getmarc

All finished! pyGetMarc should now be installed.
